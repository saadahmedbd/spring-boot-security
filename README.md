What is spring security?

=>Spring Security is a powerful framework within the Spring Framework that provides authentication, authorization, and protection against common security vulnerabilities in Java applications.

Key Features of Spring Security:

1.Authentication - Verifies the identity of users (e.g., username and password).

2.Authorization - Determines what actions or resources a user is allowed to access based on roles or permissions.

3.Session Management - Handles user sessions securely, preventing session hijacking.

4.Protection Against Attacks - Provides defenses against CSRF (Cross-Site Request Forgery), XSS (Cross-Site Scripting), and SQL Injection attacks.

5.Method-Level Security - Allows securing methods using annotations like @PreAuthorize and @Secured.

6.Password Encryption - Supports password hashing and encryption for secure storage and verification.

7.Integration with OAuth2 and JWT - Easily integrates with modern security protocols like OAuth2 and JSON Web Tokens (JWT).

8.Custom Security Rules - Allows defining custom authentication and authorization logic.

9.Enterprise-Grade Security

.Suitable for large-scale enterprise applications requiring role-based access control and multi-factor authentication.

.Simplifies security integration in microservices and cloud-native applications

Example Use Case

Imagine a banking application that requires:

Login with username and password

Two-factor authentication (2FA)

Role-based access (Admin vs User)

Protection against CSRF and XSS attacks

Spring Security can handle all these requirements efficiently with minimal custom code.
